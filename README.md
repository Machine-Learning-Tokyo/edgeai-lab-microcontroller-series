# Introduction

**MLT Edge AI Lab** was formed in 2020 when a team of researchers/engineers visited a local farm in Chiba to brainstorm solutions for problems faced by local farmers. EdgeAI Lab was formed with an aim of creating an OPEN environment where anyone can experiment with tools and apply their learnings to create quick prototypes.

**MLT Edge AI Lab with Microcontrollers Series** is created by **Naveen Kumar** and **Yoovraj Shinde**, to learn  and share about the steps in building EdgeAI applications. We will take a look at the general steps in edgeAI pipeline and the different hardwares available to deploy the models. We will also take a look at 2 simple applications, to strengthen our understanding about data collection/ processing/ building / deployment and inference.<br>

We are looking forward to active participation from the MLT community members to build cool apps together. We will do a short brainstorming session in the end to find good ideas which we can work together throughout the series.

Our goal is to help the MLT Edge AI community to build their application by end of the series.
